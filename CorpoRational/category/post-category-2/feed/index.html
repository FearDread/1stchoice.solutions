				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bad times for most enterprises equal good times for those catering to the stressed, the depressed and the anxious. As measured by the marked increase in calls to mental health hotlines whenever the unemployment rate rises and more businesses</p>
<p>Thousands of people dream of having their own business and even more so be a successful entrepreneur. But what does it take to achieve success in the business industry?</p>
<p>One of the most successful entrepreneurs featured at the Forbes website, Wendy Lipton &#8211; Dibner said that &#8220;the success of your business would solely depend on you. The only thing you can rely on is your power to achieve your goal&#8221;.<br />
She shared her success story at the Forbes website and said that when she was young she learned a very important business objective from her high school activity and that is to go out, explore, come back and explain how money is made in business. This is an objective she never forgot until she made millions for herself.</p>
<p>When she was already very successful, she never stopped understanding business and how it really works. Profit is the number one goal in business and how you make it is a natural talent. Yes, there may be a lot of guidelines given and showed on television and the internet but only you know how you will make your sales to the top.</p>
<p>Try to ponder on these notes when thinking of a business:</p>
<p>1.) Passion. Business may be set on profit but the core of your business should be something you love. Passion counts a lot in businesses because it also builds your determination in achieving your goal.</p>
<p>2.) Impact. Business is a big and competitive world, what will matter is how you make a difference to your market. How your business will impact your market. The profit of your business will rely on the impact of your business. The mark it will leave to your customers will make it grow.</p>
<p>3.) Three Guidelines.</p>
<p>If you have noticed, the three guidelines below are very simple and natural.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn which five most common mistakes a new manager is likely to make, and how to avoid them.</p>
<h3>Mistake No.1 &#8211; Who&#8217;s the Boss?</h3>
<p>Some of your subordinates will be young and new, eager to follow you. But, the experienced ones might be more resistant to your directives. especially if it comes across as an order, disregarding their experience or suggestions. Though, being the one with the responsibility, you also need to assert your authority, and make sure your employees respect you and follow you.<br />
Your subordinates have a working style of their own, and it will not work well to dictate your ways on them. Stay cool as long as they are committed to the work, compliance is another matter. Set targets and deadlines, but do not interfere in their work, especially if they are long-standing employees in the company, even though you are the one in the upper position.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 2 &#8211; I Want to Be the Cool Guy</h3>
<p>While understanding your subordinates&#8217; viewpoint and respecting their opinions is important, it is another thing if you are letting them run the show or take it easy. It is you, after all, who will have to explain things when the performance falls.<br />
Everyone hates to be the bad guy, that too, when you are new. But you have to find a balance between micromanaging and giving no direction at all. Keep your mind open for suggestions, listen to everyone, but ultimately you have to decide on the final direction your team/company takes. Also, do not excuse any slack behavior. Tardiness or frequent leaves should not be taken lightly.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 3 &#8211; Setting Uniform, Inflexible Rules</h3>
<p>If an employee is frequently late or absent, take him/her to task, but first, do understand the reasons behind this issue. Some of them might be suffering from a health condition, or they might have a sick relative at home. Same goes for other aspects of the job too.<br />
While focusing on performance and target, it is easy to forget that you are dealing with people &#8211; not processes or software which are programmed to run in a certain way. Understand that every employee is different, and will respond differently to authority or pressure. Rather than take offense, it is best to find a way around.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 4 &#8211; Not Being Clear With Instructions</h3>
<p>A few months? What exactly do you mean by few &#8211; is it two or six? As the planner, you might have a clear, precise idea of what you want. But you also need to convey that to your subordinates. Being too vague can leave them confused and lose trust in you.<br />
Make a clear, concise, and precise guideline. Give the employees fixed goals and targets. Numbers, not approximates. They need to have a proper idea of how their performance will be measured, to stay motivated and work efficiently and smartly.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 5 &#8211; Overestimating Yourself and Your Team</h3>
<p>New managers are often eager and overenthusiastic. Free from the crutches of their B-school or the restrictions of their previous job, they want to prove a lot. Brimming with new ideas, they just can&#8217;t wait to implement them and the processes that they learned. They want to bring about a positive change, and fast.<br />
This enthusiasm is very infectious, affecting the entire team, resulting in a boost in productivity and morale. But, unfortunately, it also means that the goals they set are also unrealistically high. Other employees may take time adjusting to the sudden changes a new manager and his new processes demand. Add to that, they both will need to be perfected and tweaked till you get the expected results. So, set realistic goals, and accept that the new processes might also result in losses.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are so many elements today in our lives that make things more and more hectic by the day, and there hardly seems to be any respite from the constantly mounting pressures and tough competition to stay ahead of everybody, plan for the future, etc. However, this has also led to rising stress-related issues, blood pressure, etc. While one cannot simply sit at home to avoid all this, a bit of humor has always helped in bringing cheer to one’s day.<br />
Yes, it is true. Just one good joke in a day can actually relieve a high amount of stress, and make your hormones come to their normal levels despite all the anxiety and pressures of the professional life. Think of it this way, has not there been a day when you were told a joke by a friend or relative on the phone or via SMS, and you kept on thinking about the same throughout the day, and had a great, stress-free working experience. You might also have spread the cheer by telling the joke to your colleagues, thereby also brightening their day and bringing some laughter in their lives. Is not this proof enough of what a great joke can do to your entire day?<br />
Presently, there are many sources from where one can get funny jokes, with the best one being the internet. Clearly, there are quite a few of those who like to share their humorous side online, which is visible from the great compilation of jokes that are available online. There are many kinds of redhead jokes, lawyer jokes, doctor jokes, and so on, giving you ample variety in terms of choosing the kind of laugh you want to have according to your taste.<br />
But one thing that must be kept in mind is that these jokes are completely in the spirit of humor, and should be taken sportingly, and not personally. Remember, it takes only 7 muscles to smile, and 32 to frown, and the former always gets a better reaction from the other person.</p>
