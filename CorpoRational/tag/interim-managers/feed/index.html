<p>Many students are cash-strapped, nowadays. Nevertheless, their purchasing power is very high. Research reveals that 20 million students in the US have a combined disposable income of $417 billion. Moreover, another survey of students&#8217; parents reveals that students now make 70 percent of their purchases themselves. These purchases are often made on credit cards. Therefore, students often have a significantly higher purchasing power.</p>
<p>If you know this, you can utilize it to capture the attention of the 16-24 age demographic. However, it is essential for your product or service to appeal to the lifestyle of the students. Additionally, student ambassadors should be utilized to spread the word about your product or service to their friends and classmates.</p>
<p>If you have not yet considered this demographic, it is time to reach out to them now!<br />
Social media is a popular method for socialization and communication between many young people. Students are the majority users of social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. These are the right places to introduce brands to young people.It is probably the right place to introduce a brand to them. To capture the student audience, it is essential to be a part of the conversation; it is also important to keep them engaged. Social media is the ideal platform for this.</p>
<p>However, studies state that half of these social media savvy youngsters fail to follow brands on social networking sites. Students who do follow often only show temporary, marginal support. Social media is definitely a great platform for engaging students and spreading the word. However, it is definitely not the best for brand introduction and recognition.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A visionary is one who launches a business. They have a million ideas swimming in their heads and are willing to risk an extraordinary amount in order to see their ideas happen. Their passion and belief are contagious, making it</p>
<p>What is stopping you from believing in the business of your dreams? Insecurity? Fear? Lack of confidence? All of the above? How can you overcome these obstructions?</p>
<h3>Your Mantras</h3>
<p>You may be wondering if you have the necessary skills, time, connections, and a million other things in order to create the business of your dreams. If you let your uncertainty and insecurity overpower you, you won&#8217;t ever be able to unleash your true business potential. To unlock the positive forces of your creativity and drive that will yield amazing results, make these your mantras:<br />
&#8221;I will abandon all negative thoughts that prevent me from realizing my business objectives.&#8221;<br />
&#8221;I will focus my energy on growing the business of my dreams.&#8221;</p>
<h3>A Dreamer and a Doer</h3>
<p>It is important to take time to develop your vision; and your practical thinking should be geared to this vision. You need to work with conviction. Being a dreamer does not mean that you can&#8217;t also be a doer. In fact, having a dream is the starting point for building your dream business. The problem starts when you stop there instead of setting realizable immediate targets. Success cannot come from one day to the next. So you need to build your dream business bit by bit. When your dreams begin to be transformed into reality thanks to your actions, you become aware of the power you possess for catalyzing success; and this further strengthens your determination to reach every single one of your business goals.</p>
<h3>Make It Happen</h3>
<p>Nothing can happen without tenacity, fortitude, and courage. Be bold enough to make choices; don&#8217;t just let things happen to you. Though you cannot have control over everything, you can focus on what you can handle and influence with your actions in a given situation. You have the power to make decisions that will move your business forward. You should not feel daunted by your lack of knowledge of business strategies either. You learn and grow while building your business. No women entrepreneur/mompreneur possesses absolute knowledge; there are so many examples of hugely successful businesswomen who started out without having any clue about business promotion techniques. Their motivation to learn, their unwavering belief that they could create the business of their dreams, and their steadfastness were key factors for their success.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rumi, is the most popular Sufi poet in the world. His work is not only deep and intense, but also very ethereal. His poetry often stirs an emotion never touched and shows a facet never seen. This Buzzle article has a collection of some beautiful Rumi quotes that are worth reading, without which, life would literally feel quite disregarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you start to walk on the way, the way appears.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Two there are who are never satisfied &#8212; the lover of the world and the lover of knowledge.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What you seek is seeking you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be satisfied with stories, how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do you know what you are? You are a manuscript oƒ a divine letter. You are a mirror reflecting a noble face. This universe is not outside of you. Look inside yourself; everything that you want, you are already that.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t grieve. Anything you lose comes round in another form.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Start a huge, foolish project, like Noah&#8230;it makes absolutely no difference what people think of you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;When you go through a hard period, when everything seems to oppose you, &#8230; When you feel you cannot even bear one more minute, NEVER GIVE UP! Because it is the time and place that the course will divert!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So how to keep your heart healthy? With so many heart diseases on the rise, most health-conscious people strive to seek the answer to this question. This article attempts to help you find the answer.</p>
<h3>Go Green</h3>
<p>When we speak of heart, we cannot miss out on the importance and benefits of plant foods. Vegetables are an excellent source of glutamic acid. It is a class of amino acid which helps keeping blood pressure at lower levels; safe levels, so to say. What&#8217;s more? Veggies lack cholesterol, fat and even calories, which otherwise tend to be the common culprits for causing heart diseases. Not to mention, the amount of vitamins and minerals that vegetables provide to the body do the most for health.</p>
<h3>Be Active</h3>
<p>Without the aid of daily exercise, maintaining a good overall health is just more than a daunting task. Exercises not only improve heart function, but also help in bringing down blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in the body. A mere 30 minutes stroll daily does good for the heart, if not much. It is recommended that sprinting is more beneficial for the heart, than jogging.</p>
<h3>Reduce Oil</h3>
<p>The next tip is about keeping oil from your diet. Although, you cannot avoid oil completely, you can keep its consumption to a small amount. Oils are a storehouse of calories and contain little nutrition. As they mostly comprise fat, they have all chances to lead to the development of plaque in the arteries thus, giving rise to some nasty heart problems. However, not all types of oil are unhealthy. Fish oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which not only help in preventing cardiovascular diseases, but also reduce instances of heart attack. According to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, a group of patients with cardiovascular disease had 30% less likelihood of heart attack because of omega-3 fatty acids. Best sources include salmon, mackerel and herring. Flaxseed, walnuts, and soybeans are also good sources.</p>
<h3>Cut the Smoke</h3>
<p>If you think you cannot shun the habit of smoking, then you might as well know that you cannot do anything good for your heart. One of the most severe risks of smoking relates to heart diseases in almost every smoker. Quit smoking, and you have done half the job in keeping your heart healthy!</p>
<h3>Lose Weight</h3>
<p>If your figure is slim, and belly flat, then you may have less things to worry about heart diseases. I am talking about weight loss. Being overweight puts extra load on the heart thus, increases the risk of heart conditions. So, consume less sugary foods and more of fiber and complex carbohydrates, and fruits and vegetables. Maintaining a healthy weight is one of the basic necessities for a healthy heart today.</p>
<h3>Add More Fiber</h3>
<p>Fiber exists in two major groups; soluble (dissolves in water) and insoluble (does not dissolve in water). Although both the types are beneficial to health, it is the former type that does way better to reduce cholesterol levels in the body. Due to its soluble nature, it binds with the cholesterol in the intestines thus, keep it from being absorbed. This keeps the level of LDL and total cholesterol down, while not affecting the HDL cholesterol level in any way. All a healthy person requires is a serving of 5 to 10 grams or more of soluble fiber in a day to avail this benefit of low cholesterol. Foods rich in this fiber include apples, peas, kidney beans, prunes, etc.</p>
<h3>Beware of Saturated Fats</h3>
<p>It is important that you limit the amount of saturated and trans fats you consume from your food. These spike cholesterol levels in the body thus, increasing the risk of coronary artery disease. So avoid or limit consumption of food such as red meat, dairy products, coconut oil, palm oil. These are rich in saturated fatty acids. To avoid trans fats, eat less of fast foods, bakery products, snacks, crackers, and margarines. Go for foods rich in healthy fats such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.</p>
<h3>Eat Less Salt</h3>
<p>Sodium is good for the body, but in petty amounts. High salt intake means high blood pressure, which eventually points out to heart conditions. When sodium starts accumulating in the blood, it attracts water which in turn, increases the blood volume. Now to keep this blood circulating through the blood vessels, the heart has to work harder thus, causing high blood pressure. The recommended amount of sodium in the food per day must be less than 2300 milligrams.</p>
<h3>Take the Right Medication</h3>
<p>In most cases, heart diseases are also related to the use of drugs. So, it is important that you take medicines as prescribed by the doctors, or get them altered if necessary.</p>
<h3>Moderate Alcohol</h3>
<p>Drinking alcohol in moderate amounts does not harm the body. In fact, some studies show that moderate consumption provides some benefits for the heart. However, the habit of drinking is analogous to walking on thin ice. It is not difficult for any one to step out of his limit, and become a heavy drinker. So, ensure that either you stick to moderate drinking or you don&#8217;t drink at all.</p>
<h3>Manage Stress</h3>
<p>Stress has also been known to be one of the common culprits of heart problems. Any stressful situation elevates blood pressure and this response takes its toll on the heart. So, keep yourself relaxed by practicing meditation, yoga, and other relaxation techniques.</p>
<p>To conclude, make a note of the above methods, and keep them handy in case you find it difficult to recall them. And now I would like to take your leave, as I have some sprinting to do! Take care!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to remodeling an office, one of the most important aspects is painting. Any shade of paint can change the complete look of a room as a color has an ability to change a drab and boring room into a stunning one. Many people prefer to paint their homes in serene colors as it relaxes the mind. There are many hues of colors to choose from that match the atmosphere of a room.</p>
<p>An office is a place where many people come and go. Choose some paint colors that will stimulate the employees, relax the customers and make them feel welcome. Here are some ideas for interior paint colors and combinations to remodel your office and make it look more appealing to the vision.<br />
Avoid using white, as this color gives a very sterile look to the walls. Remember a shade of color can make a room look large or small. So, it is better to avoid black or dark colors that will give off a repulsive look to your office.<br />
The popular choice of paint colors that will give a soothing and inviting look to your office are beige, tan, light yellow and some shades of blue.<br />
When you choose paint colors for your office make sure that these colors have a resemblance to the flooring and office furniture.</p>
<p>These were some tips for choosing paint colors. Before you paint the walls of the room, always paint a small portion of the wall to check how it looks. If you are satisfied with the result, you can go ahead with the task, or else you can always try other combinations. Whatever color you choose, make sure that it serves its purpose and brightens up the atmosphere of the room. Happy painting!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn which five most common mistakes a new manager is likely to make, and how to avoid them.</p>
<h3>Mistake No.1 &#8211; Who&#8217;s the Boss?</h3>
<p>Some of your subordinates will be young and new, eager to follow you. But, the experienced ones might be more resistant to your directives. especially if it comes across as an order, disregarding their experience or suggestions. Though, being the one with the responsibility, you also need to assert your authority, and make sure your employees respect you and follow you.<br />
Your subordinates have a working style of their own, and it will not work well to dictate your ways on them. Stay cool as long as they are committed to the work, compliance is another matter. Set targets and deadlines, but do not interfere in their work, especially if they are long-standing employees in the company, even though you are the one in the upper position.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 2 &#8211; I Want to Be the Cool Guy</h3>
<p>While understanding your subordinates&#8217; viewpoint and respecting their opinions is important, it is another thing if you are letting them run the show or take it easy. It is you, after all, who will have to explain things when the performance falls.<br />
Everyone hates to be the bad guy, that too, when you are new. But you have to find a balance between micromanaging and giving no direction at all. Keep your mind open for suggestions, listen to everyone, but ultimately you have to decide on the final direction your team/company takes. Also, do not excuse any slack behavior. Tardiness or frequent leaves should not be taken lightly.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 3 &#8211; Setting Uniform, Inflexible Rules</h3>
<p>If an employee is frequently late or absent, take him/her to task, but first, do understand the reasons behind this issue. Some of them might be suffering from a health condition, or they might have a sick relative at home. Same goes for other aspects of the job too.<br />
While focusing on performance and target, it is easy to forget that you are dealing with people &#8211; not processes or software which are programmed to run in a certain way. Understand that every employee is different, and will respond differently to authority or pressure. Rather than take offense, it is best to find a way around.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 4 &#8211; Not Being Clear With Instructions</h3>
<p>A few months? What exactly do you mean by few &#8211; is it two or six? As the planner, you might have a clear, precise idea of what you want. But you also need to convey that to your subordinates. Being too vague can leave them confused and lose trust in you.<br />
Make a clear, concise, and precise guideline. Give the employees fixed goals and targets. Numbers, not approximates. They need to have a proper idea of how their performance will be measured, to stay motivated and work efficiently and smartly.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 5 &#8211; Overestimating Yourself and Your Team</h3>
<p>New managers are often eager and overenthusiastic. Free from the crutches of their B-school or the restrictions of their previous job, they want to prove a lot. Brimming with new ideas, they just can&#8217;t wait to implement them and the processes that they learned. They want to bring about a positive change, and fast.<br />
This enthusiasm is very infectious, affecting the entire team, resulting in a boost in productivity and morale. But, unfortunately, it also means that the goals they set are also unrealistically high. Other employees may take time adjusting to the sudden changes a new manager and his new processes demand. Add to that, they both will need to be perfected and tweaked till you get the expected results. So, set realistic goals, and accept that the new processes might also result in losses.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An increasing number of people now want to do their part to save the planet due to the worsening problems caused by global warming. Unfortunately, numerous people assume that going green is costly and time consuming. Read on to discover several immediate things you can do to get on the path to living green.<br />
Recycling is the top way to start. A lot of people continue to place glass and aluminum items in their normal garbage even though recycling is not that hard to do today. In the US, it&#8217;s not hard to locate a trash service that offers glass and aluminum recycling choices. Many people still continue to discard these items even though recycling bins are not hard to find. It merely takes a few minutes to wash off the cans and bottles before placing them into the recycle bin.<br />
Newspapers are other items that overburden our landfills. Virtually all people will merely take their daily paper and toss it in the garbage when they are done with it. But, there are many other uses that you can get out of your newsprint other than poring over it. Did you know that you can keep your windows clean using newspapers? If you&#8217;re tired of seeing small white fragments and streaks on your windowpanes after you clean them with paper towels and cleaner, try to use old newspapers instead. Several community groups run regular paper drives. Merely compile all of your old newspapers, put them in a stack, and see if the paper drive organizers will come to your location and pick them up.<br />
One more thing that could help you to start to live green is to begin walking a bit more. Lots of people routinely drive short distances merely to buy one thing at their local corner market. If you just walk to the store, it can take less time, because you won&#8217;t have to locate a parking spot, but you will be saving money on gas and helping to save planet Earth by not burning those fuels.<br />
If you wish to save even more on gas, take the chance to carpool when you can and only mow your lawn two times a month instead of weekly. A gorgeous lawn is good to have but skipping an additional week before you mow again shouldn&#8217;t significantly affect it. Using a manual push mower like those more normally used many, many years ago will help to save the environment even more. Numerous hardware shops still carry this type of mower.<br />
When people make up their mind to try green living, it&#8217;s easy to make a few lifestyle modifications that will benefit our environment. Likewise, you can find lots of info all over the Internet on other ways to start living green, you only have to look for it.</p>

<p>Many students are cash-strapped, nowadays. Nevertheless, their purchasing power is very high. Research reveals that 20 million students in the US have a combined disposable income of $417 billion. Moreover, another survey of students&#8217; parents reveals that students now make 70 percent of their purchases themselves. These purchases are often made on credit cards. Therefore, students often have a significantly higher purchasing power.</p>
<p>If you know this, you can utilize it to capture the attention of the 16-24 age demographic. However, it is essential for your product or service to appeal to the lifestyle of the students. Additionally, student ambassadors should be utilized to spread the word about your product or service to their friends and classmates.</p>
<p>If you have not yet considered this demographic, it is time to reach out to them now!<br />
Social media is a popular method for socialization and communication between many young people. Students are the majority users of social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. These are the right places to introduce brands to young people.It is probably the right place to introduce a brand to them. To capture the student audience, it is essential to be a part of the conversation; it is also important to keep them engaged. Social media is the ideal platform for this.</p>
<p>However, studies state that half of these social media savvy youngsters fail to follow brands on social networking sites. Students who do follow often only show temporary, marginal support. Social media is definitely a great platform for engaging students and spreading the word. However, it is definitely not the best for brand introduction and recognition.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rumi, is the most popular Sufi poet in the world. His work is not only deep and intense, but also very ethereal. His poetry often stirs an emotion never touched and shows a facet never seen. This Buzzle article has a collection of some beautiful Rumi quotes that are worth reading, without which, life would literally feel quite disregarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you start to walk on the way, the way appears.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Two there are who are never satisfied &#8212; the lover of the world and the lover of knowledge.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What you seek is seeking you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be satisfied with stories, how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do you know what you are? You are a manuscript oƒ a divine letter. You are a mirror reflecting a noble face. This universe is not outside of you. Look inside yourself; everything that you want, you are already that.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t grieve. Anything you lose comes round in another form.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Start a huge, foolish project, like Noah&#8230;it makes absolutely no difference what people think of you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;When you go through a hard period, when everything seems to oppose you, &#8230; When you feel you cannot even bear one more minute, NEVER GIVE UP! Because it is the time and place that the course will divert!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So how to keep your heart healthy? With so many heart diseases on the rise, most health-conscious people strive to seek the answer to this question. This article attempts to help you find the answer.</p>
<h3>Go Green</h3>
<p>When we speak of heart, we cannot miss out on the importance and benefits of plant foods. Vegetables are an excellent source of glutamic acid. It is a class of amino acid which helps keeping blood pressure at lower levels; safe levels, so to say. What&#8217;s more? Veggies lack cholesterol, fat and even calories, which otherwise tend to be the common culprits for causing heart diseases. Not to mention, the amount of vitamins and minerals that vegetables provide to the body do the most for health.</p>
<h3>Be Active</h3>
<p>Without the aid of daily exercise, maintaining a good overall health is just more than a daunting task. Exercises not only improve heart function, but also help in bringing down blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in the body. A mere 30 minutes stroll daily does good for the heart, if not much. It is recommended that sprinting is more beneficial for the heart, than jogging.</p>
<h3>Reduce Oil</h3>
<p>The next tip is about keeping oil from your diet. Although, you cannot avoid oil completely, you can keep its consumption to a small amount. Oils are a storehouse of calories and contain little nutrition. As they mostly comprise fat, they have all chances to lead to the development of plaque in the arteries thus, giving rise to some nasty heart problems. However, not all types of oil are unhealthy. Fish oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which not only help in preventing cardiovascular diseases, but also reduce instances of heart attack. According to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, a group of patients with cardiovascular disease had 30% less likelihood of heart attack because of omega-3 fatty acids. Best sources include salmon, mackerel and herring. Flaxseed, walnuts, and soybeans are also good sources.</p>
<h3>Cut the Smoke</h3>
<p>If you think you cannot shun the habit of smoking, then you might as well know that you cannot do anything good for your heart. One of the most severe risks of smoking relates to heart diseases in almost every smoker. Quit smoking, and you have done half the job in keeping your heart healthy!</p>
<h3>Lose Weight</h3>
<p>If your figure is slim, and belly flat, then you may have less things to worry about heart diseases. I am talking about weight loss. Being overweight puts extra load on the heart thus, increases the risk of heart conditions. So, consume less sugary foods and more of fiber and complex carbohydrates, and fruits and vegetables. Maintaining a healthy weight is one of the basic necessities for a healthy heart today.</p>
<h3>Add More Fiber</h3>
<p>Fiber exists in two major groups; soluble (dissolves in water) and insoluble (does not dissolve in water). Although both the types are beneficial to health, it is the former type that does way better to reduce cholesterol levels in the body. Due to its soluble nature, it binds with the cholesterol in the intestines thus, keep it from being absorbed. This keeps the level of LDL and total cholesterol down, while not affecting the HDL cholesterol level in any way. All a healthy person requires is a serving of 5 to 10 grams or more of soluble fiber in a day to avail this benefit of low cholesterol. Foods rich in this fiber include apples, peas, kidney beans, prunes, etc.</p>
<h3>Beware of Saturated Fats</h3>
<p>It is important that you limit the amount of saturated and trans fats you consume from your food. These spike cholesterol levels in the body thus, increasing the risk of coronary artery disease. So avoid or limit consumption of food such as red meat, dairy products, coconut oil, palm oil. These are rich in saturated fatty acids. To avoid trans fats, eat less of fast foods, bakery products, snacks, crackers, and margarines. Go for foods rich in healthy fats such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.</p>
<h3>Eat Less Salt</h3>
<p>Sodium is good for the body, but in petty amounts. High salt intake means high blood pressure, which eventually points out to heart conditions. When sodium starts accumulating in the blood, it attracts water which in turn, increases the blood volume. Now to keep this blood circulating through the blood vessels, the heart has to work harder thus, causing high blood pressure. The recommended amount of sodium in the food per day must be less than 2300 milligrams.</p>
<h3>Take the Right Medication</h3>
<p>In most cases, heart diseases are also related to the use of drugs. So, it is important that you take medicines as prescribed by the doctors, or get them altered if necessary.</p>
<h3>Moderate Alcohol</h3>
<p>Drinking alcohol in moderate amounts does not harm the body. In fact, some studies show that moderate consumption provides some benefits for the heart. However, the habit of drinking is analogous to walking on thin ice. It is not difficult for any one to step out of his limit, and become a heavy drinker. So, ensure that either you stick to moderate drinking or you don&#8217;t drink at all.</p>
<h3>Manage Stress</h3>
<p>Stress has also been known to be one of the common culprits of heart problems. Any stressful situation elevates blood pressure and this response takes its toll on the heart. So, keep yourself relaxed by practicing meditation, yoga, and other relaxation techniques.</p>
<p>To conclude, make a note of the above methods, and keep them handy in case you find it difficult to recall them. And now I would like to take your leave, as I have some sprinting to do! Take care!</p>
