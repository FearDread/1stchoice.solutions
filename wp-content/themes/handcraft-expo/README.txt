	INTRODUCTION:
	
	Handcraft Expo is a free (as in freedom) WordPress theme which focuses 
	on effective communication design by merging well-established concepts 
	with the use - and abuse - of graphical effects. A traditional, solid 
	left sidebar concept spin-off aimed to 'streamline what really matters'.
	The project was born with the specific need to highlight handcrafts, 
	hence its name.
	
	Layouts:
	
	The theme switches from a 'standard' left sidebar layout on +1180px(w) and 
	+767px(h) screens to a 'pocket' layout on smaller sizes and handheld devices.

	IMPORTANT: SELECT YOUR MENUS BEFORE CUSTOMIZING.
	
	Colors:
	
	Though the theme allows you to customize most colors, it still tries to 
	preserve an 'intelligent' relationship between elements: it is then highly 
	recommended to choose a color for each proposed entry (even for items you are 
	not going to show on the website) to help Handcraft Expo complete its 
	'virtual palette'.
	
	Highlights:
	
	 # GNU GPL v3;

	 # WordPress Customizer options-packed: easily adjust the website's look;
	
	 # Highly animated: graphical aid to help you explain single menu items;
	
	 # Styled horizontal custom menu on top widget;

	CUSTOMIZER:
	
	
	
	 -- Site Identity --
	
	Show title and tagline: When "On Banner" is selected, title and tagline will 
	   be visible ONLY if you select a banner image first 
	   (Background -> Banner Image).
	
	Title position: When "On Banner" is selected, title and tagline will be 
	   visible ONLY if you select a banner image first 
	   (Background -> Banner Image).

	   NOTE: Handcraft Expo does NOT support WordPress Custom Headers.
	
	Title offsets: 'pocket' layout will always display centered title and tagline.
	
	Title hover effect: Choose a title and tagline animation when mouse-hovering;
	   NOTE: Title SCALE effect amount and Title ROTATE effect amounts are 
	   ONLY active when either "Color, scale and rotate" or "Full" or title 
	   hover effect is selected.
	
	
	
	 -- Logo --
	
	Logo: If a logo is uploaded, it will be placed on the Menu Sidebar, on page 
	   center in 'pocket' layout and will also become a clickable link to the 
	   homepage.
	
	
	
	 -- Background --
	
	Choose a banner, an image and a color for your website background. Banner 
	images will display on top of the page and will force the background picture 
	to be displayed on content area. When in 'standard' layout and without a 
	'banner' image, the theme should be setup by resizing the browser's window 
	heigth just above the breaking point and making sure that all items in the 
	menu sidebar are visible.
	
	NOTE: Handcraft Expo does NOT support WordPress Custom Backgrounds.
	
	
	
	 -- Pages --
	
	Display pages titles: choose where to display page titles. NOTE: some 
		page templates might override this setting.
	
	Choose a content footer image: Handcraft Expo suggests to use ONLY images 
		with low opacity and high transparency and contrast in order to 
		resemble a watermark effect.
	
	
	
	 -- Previewer --
	
	Handcraft Expo's most recognizable feature, Previewer helps you communicate 
	with your visitors by providing a customizable animated preview box when 
	hovering on Sidebar Menu's links. Previewer can handle up to 8 link 
	description fields (the 3rd is always reserved to "sticky" or latest post) 
	and you can add a picture on any of them.
	
	NOTE: Due to its nature, Previewer will display in a slightly different 
	position on every screen: adjust the offsets and try different window sizes to 
	fit your specific communication needs.
	
	Previewer Background image: Handcraft Expo suggests to use ONLY images with 
		low opacity and high transparency and contrast in order to resemble a 
		watermark effect.
	
	
	
	 -- Menu Sidebar --
	
	Choose Menu Bar's transparency level, its border color and witdh and Menu Links 
	font size. Note: will automatically adapt on smaller screens.
	
	Show Sidebar gradient: Suggested if using a full-screen background image.
	
	
	 -- Widgets --
	
	When activated, the widgets Sidebar will by default hide the sidebar and show 
	a toggle button. NOTE: the theme should be setup by resizing your browser's 
	window heigth just above the breaking point and making sure that all items in 
	the menu sidebar are visible.
	
	And if you are emotionally attached to horizontal menus, Handcraft Expo 
	offers a pre-styled custom menu on the Top Widget position.
