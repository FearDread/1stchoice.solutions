<p>Many students are cash-strapped, nowadays. Nevertheless, their purchasing power is very high. Research reveals that 20 million students in the US have a combined disposable income of $417 billion. Moreover, another survey of students&#8217; parents reveals that students now make 70 percent of their purchases themselves. These purchases are often made on credit cards. Therefore, students often have a significantly higher purchasing power.</p>
<p>If you know this, you can utilize it to capture the attention of the 16-24 age demographic. However, it is essential for your product or service to appeal to the lifestyle of the students. Additionally, student ambassadors should be utilized to spread the word about your product or service to their friends and classmates.</p>
<p>If you have not yet considered this demographic, it is time to reach out to them now!<br />
Social media is a popular method for socialization and communication between many young people. Students are the majority users of social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. These are the right places to introduce brands to young people.It is probably the right place to introduce a brand to them. To capture the student audience, it is essential to be a part of the conversation; it is also important to keep them engaged. Social media is the ideal platform for this.</p>
<p>However, studies state that half of these social media savvy youngsters fail to follow brands on social networking sites. Students who do follow often only show temporary, marginal support. Social media is definitely a great platform for engaging students and spreading the word. However, it is definitely not the best for brand introduction and recognition.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bad times for most enterprises equal good times for those catering to the stressed, the depressed and the anxious. As measured by the marked increase in calls to mental health hotlines whenever the unemployment rate rises and more businesses</p>
<p>Thousands of people dream of having their own business and even more so be a successful entrepreneur. But what does it take to achieve success in the business industry?</p>
<p>One of the most successful entrepreneurs featured at the Forbes website, Wendy Lipton &#8211; Dibner said that &#8220;the success of your business would solely depend on you. The only thing you can rely on is your power to achieve your goal&#8221;.<br />
She shared her success story at the Forbes website and said that when she was young she learned a very important business objective from her high school activity and that is to go out, explore, come back and explain how money is made in business. This is an objective she never forgot until she made millions for herself.</p>
<p>When she was already very successful, she never stopped understanding business and how it really works. Profit is the number one goal in business and how you make it is a natural talent. Yes, there may be a lot of guidelines given and showed on television and the internet but only you know how you will make your sales to the top.</p>
<p>Try to ponder on these notes when thinking of a business:</p>
<p>1.) Passion. Business may be set on profit but the core of your business should be something you love. Passion counts a lot in businesses because it also builds your determination in achieving your goal.</p>
<p>2.) Impact. Business is a big and competitive world, what will matter is how you make a difference to your market. How your business will impact your market. The profit of your business will rely on the impact of your business. The mark it will leave to your customers will make it grow.</p>
<p>3.) Three Guidelines.</p>
<p>If you have noticed, the three guidelines below are very simple and natural.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rumi, is the most popular Sufi poet in the world. His work is not only deep and intense, but also very ethereal. His poetry often stirs an emotion never touched and shows a facet never seen. This Buzzle article has a collection of some beautiful Rumi quotes that are worth reading, without which, life would literally feel quite disregarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you start to walk on the way, the way appears.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Two there are who are never satisfied &#8212; the lover of the world and the lover of knowledge.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What you seek is seeking you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be satisfied with stories, how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do you know what you are? You are a manuscript oƒ a divine letter. You are a mirror reflecting a noble face. This universe is not outside of you. Look inside yourself; everything that you want, you are already that.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t grieve. Anything you lose comes round in another form.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Start a huge, foolish project, like Noah&#8230;it makes absolutely no difference what people think of you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;When you go through a hard period, when everything seems to oppose you, &#8230; When you feel you cannot even bear one more minute, NEVER GIVE UP! Because it is the time and place that the course will divert!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Verbal communication include sounds, words, language, and speech. Speaking is an effective way of communicating and helps in expressing our emotions in words. This form of communication is further classified into four types, which are:</p>
<h3>1. Intrapersonal Communication</h3>
<p>This form of communication is extremely private and restricted to ourselves. It includes the silent conversations we have with ourselves, wherein we juggle roles between the sender and receiver who are processing our thoughts and actions. This process of communication when analyzed can either be conveyed verbally to someone or stay confined as thoughts.</p>
<h3>2. Interpersonal Communication</h3>
<p>This form of communication takes place between two individuals and is thus a one-on-one conversation. Here, the two individuals involved will swap their roles of sender and receiver in order to communicate in a clearer manner.</p>
<h3>3. Small Group Communication</h3>
<p>This type of communication can take place only when there are more than two people involved. Here the number of people will be small enough to allow each participant to interact and converse with the rest. Press conferences, board meetings, and team meetings are examples of group communication. Unless a specific issue is being discussed, small group discussions can become chaotic and difficult to interpret by everybody. This lag in understanding information completely can result in miscommunication.</p>
<h3>4. Public Communication</h3>
<p>This type of communication takes place when one individual addresses a large gathering of people. Election campaigns and public speeches are example of this type of communication. In such cases, there is usually a single sender of information and several receivers who are being addressed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to remodeling an office, one of the most important aspects is painting. Any shade of paint can change the complete look of a room as a color has an ability to change a drab and boring room into a stunning one. Many people prefer to paint their homes in serene colors as it relaxes the mind. There are many hues of colors to choose from that match the atmosphere of a room.</p>
<p>An office is a place where many people come and go. Choose some paint colors that will stimulate the employees, relax the customers and make them feel welcome. Here are some ideas for interior paint colors and combinations to remodel your office and make it look more appealing to the vision.<br />
Avoid using white, as this color gives a very sterile look to the walls. Remember a shade of color can make a room look large or small. So, it is better to avoid black or dark colors that will give off a repulsive look to your office.<br />
The popular choice of paint colors that will give a soothing and inviting look to your office are beige, tan, light yellow and some shades of blue.<br />
When you choose paint colors for your office make sure that these colors have a resemblance to the flooring and office furniture.</p>
<p>These were some tips for choosing paint colors. Before you paint the walls of the room, always paint a small portion of the wall to check how it looks. If you are satisfied with the result, you can go ahead with the task, or else you can always try other combinations. Whatever color you choose, make sure that it serves its purpose and brightens up the atmosphere of the room. Happy painting!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are so many elements today in our lives that make things more and more hectic by the day, and there hardly seems to be any respite from the constantly mounting pressures and tough competition to stay ahead of everybody, plan for the future, etc. However, this has also led to rising stress-related issues, blood pressure, etc. While one cannot simply sit at home to avoid all this, a bit of humor has always helped in bringing cheer to one’s day.<br />
Yes, it is true. Just one good joke in a day can actually relieve a high amount of stress, and make your hormones come to their normal levels despite all the anxiety and pressures of the professional life. Think of it this way, has not there been a day when you were told a joke by a friend or relative on the phone or via SMS, and you kept on thinking about the same throughout the day, and had a great, stress-free working experience. You might also have spread the cheer by telling the joke to your colleagues, thereby also brightening their day and bringing some laughter in their lives. Is not this proof enough of what a great joke can do to your entire day?<br />
Presently, there are many sources from where one can get funny jokes, with the best one being the internet. Clearly, there are quite a few of those who like to share their humorous side online, which is visible from the great compilation of jokes that are available online. There are many kinds of redhead jokes, lawyer jokes, doctor jokes, and so on, giving you ample variety in terms of choosing the kind of laugh you want to have according to your taste.<br />
But one thing that must be kept in mind is that these jokes are completely in the spirit of humor, and should be taken sportingly, and not personally. Remember, it takes only 7 muscles to smile, and 32 to frown, and the former always gets a better reaction from the other person.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An increasing number of people now want to do their part to save the planet due to the worsening problems caused by global warming. Unfortunately, numerous people assume that going green is costly and time consuming. Read on to discover several immediate things you can do to get on the path to living green.<br />
Recycling is the top way to start. A lot of people continue to place glass and aluminum items in their normal garbage even though recycling is not that hard to do today. In the US, it&#8217;s not hard to locate a trash service that offers glass and aluminum recycling choices. Many people still continue to discard these items even though recycling bins are not hard to find. It merely takes a few minutes to wash off the cans and bottles before placing them into the recycle bin.<br />
Newspapers are other items that overburden our landfills. Virtually all people will merely take their daily paper and toss it in the garbage when they are done with it. But, there are many other uses that you can get out of your newsprint other than poring over it. Did you know that you can keep your windows clean using newspapers? If you&#8217;re tired of seeing small white fragments and streaks on your windowpanes after you clean them with paper towels and cleaner, try to use old newspapers instead. Several community groups run regular paper drives. Merely compile all of your old newspapers, put them in a stack, and see if the paper drive organizers will come to your location and pick them up.<br />
One more thing that could help you to start to live green is to begin walking a bit more. Lots of people routinely drive short distances merely to buy one thing at their local corner market. If you just walk to the store, it can take less time, because you won&#8217;t have to locate a parking spot, but you will be saving money on gas and helping to save planet Earth by not burning those fuels.<br />
If you wish to save even more on gas, take the chance to carpool when you can and only mow your lawn two times a month instead of weekly. A gorgeous lawn is good to have but skipping an additional week before you mow again shouldn&#8217;t significantly affect it. Using a manual push mower like those more normally used many, many years ago will help to save the environment even more. Numerous hardware shops still carry this type of mower.<br />
When people make up their mind to try green living, it&#8217;s easy to make a few lifestyle modifications that will benefit our environment. Likewise, you can find lots of info all over the Internet on other ways to start living green, you only have to look for it.</p>

&#8220;Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Start a huge, foolish project, like Noah&#8230;it makes absolutely no difference what people think of you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;When you go through a hard period, when everything seems to oppose you, &#8230; When you feel you cannot even bear one more minute, NEVER GIVE UP! Because it is the time and place that the course will divert!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Verbal communication include sounds, words, language, and speech. Speaking is an effective way of communicating and helps in expressing our emotions in words. This form of communication is further classified into four types, which are:</p>
<h3>1. Intrapersonal Communication</h3>
<p>This form of communication is extremely private and restricted to ourselves. It includes the silent conversations we have with ourselves, wherein we juggle roles between the sender and receiver who are processing our thoughts and actions. This process of communication when analyzed can either be conveyed verbally to someone or stay confined as thoughts.</p>
<h3>2. Interpersonal Communication</h3>
<p>This form of communication takes place between two individuals and is thus a one-on-one conversation. Here, the two individuals involved will swap their roles of sender and receiver in order to communicate in a clearer manner.</p>
<h3>3. Small Group Communication</h3>
<p>This type of communication can take place only when there are more than two people involved. Here the number of people will be small enough to allow each participant to interact and converse with the rest. Press conferences, board meetings, and team meetings are examples of group communication. Unless a specific issue is being discussed, small group discussions can become chaotic and difficult to interpret by everybody. This lag in understanding information completely can result in miscommunication.</p>
<h3>4. Public Communication</h3>
<p>This type of communication takes place when one individual addresses a large gathering of people. Election campaigns and public speeches are example of this type of communication. In such cases, there is usually a single sender of information and several receivers who are being addressed.</p>
