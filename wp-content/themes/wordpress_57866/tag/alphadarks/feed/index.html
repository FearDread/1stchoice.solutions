				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Verbal communication include sounds, words, language, and speech. Speaking is an effective way of communicating and helps in expressing our emotions in words. This form of communication is further classified into four types, which are:</p>
<h3>1. Intrapersonal Communication</h3>
<p>This form of communication is extremely private and restricted to ourselves. It includes the silent conversations we have with ourselves, wherein we juggle roles between the sender and receiver who are processing our thoughts and actions. This process of communication when analyzed can either be conveyed verbally to someone or stay confined as thoughts.</p>
<h3>2. Interpersonal Communication</h3>
<p>This form of communication takes place between two individuals and is thus a one-on-one conversation. Here, the two individuals involved will swap their roles of sender and receiver in order to communicate in a clearer manner.</p>
<h3>3. Small Group Communication</h3>
<p>This type of communication can take place only when there are more than two people involved. Here the number of people will be small enough to allow each participant to interact and converse with the rest. Press conferences, board meetings, and team meetings are examples of group communication. Unless a specific issue is being discussed, small group discussions can become chaotic and difficult to interpret by everybody. This lag in understanding information completely can result in miscommunication.</p>
<h3>4. Public Communication</h3>
<p>This type of communication takes place when one individual addresses a large gathering of people. Election campaigns and public speeches are example of this type of communication. In such cases, there is usually a single sender of information and several receivers who are being addressed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to remodeling an office, one of the most important aspects is painting. Any shade of paint can change the complete look of a room as a color has an ability to change a drab and boring room into a stunning one. Many people prefer to paint their homes in serene colors as it relaxes the mind. There are many hues of colors to choose from that match the atmosphere of a room.</p>
<p>An office is a place where many people come and go. Choose some paint colors that will stimulate the employees, relax the customers and make them feel welcome. Here are some ideas for interior paint colors and combinations to remodel your office and make it look more appealing to the vision.<br />
Avoid using white, as this color gives a very sterile look to the walls. Remember a shade of color can make a room look large or small. So, it is better to avoid black or dark colors that will give off a repulsive look to your office.<br />
The popular choice of paint colors that will give a soothing and inviting look to your office are beige, tan, light yellow and some shades of blue.<br />
When you choose paint colors for your office make sure that these colors have a resemblance to the flooring and office furniture.</p>
<p>These were some tips for choosing paint colors. Before you paint the walls of the room, always paint a small portion of the wall to check how it looks. If you are satisfied with the result, you can go ahead with the task, or else you can always try other combinations. Whatever color you choose, make sure that it serves its purpose and brightens up the atmosphere of the room. Happy painting!</p>
