				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to remodeling an office, one of the most important aspects is painting. Any shade of paint can change the complete look of a room as a color has an ability to change a drab and boring room into a stunning one. Many people prefer to paint their homes in serene colors as it relaxes the mind. There are many hues of colors to choose from that match the atmosphere of a room.</p>
<p>An office is a place where many people come and go. Choose some paint colors that will stimulate the employees, relax the customers and make them feel welcome. Here are some ideas for interior paint colors and combinations to remodel your office and make it look more appealing to the vision.<br />
Avoid using white, as this color gives a very sterile look to the walls. Remember a shade of color can make a room look large or small. So, it is better to avoid black or dark colors that will give off a repulsive look to your office.<br />
The popular choice of paint colors that will give a soothing and inviting look to your office are beige, tan, light yellow and some shades of blue.<br />
When you choose paint colors for your office make sure that these colors have a resemblance to the flooring and office furniture.</p>
<p>These were some tips for choosing paint colors. Before you paint the walls of the room, always paint a small portion of the wall to check how it looks. If you are satisfied with the result, you can go ahead with the task, or else you can always try other combinations. Whatever color you choose, make sure that it serves its purpose and brightens up the atmosphere of the room. Happy painting!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn which five most common mistakes a new manager is likely to make, and how to avoid them.</p>
<h3>Mistake No.1 &#8211; Who&#8217;s the Boss?</h3>
<p>Some of your subordinates will be young and new, eager to follow you. But, the experienced ones might be more resistant to your directives. especially if it comes across as an order, disregarding their experience or suggestions. Though, being the one with the responsibility, you also need to assert your authority, and make sure your employees respect you and follow you.<br />
Your subordinates have a working style of their own, and it will not work well to dictate your ways on them. Stay cool as long as they are committed to the work, compliance is another matter. Set targets and deadlines, but do not interfere in their work, especially if they are long-standing employees in the company, even though you are the one in the upper position.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 2 &#8211; I Want to Be the Cool Guy</h3>
<p>While understanding your subordinates&#8217; viewpoint and respecting their opinions is important, it is another thing if you are letting them run the show or take it easy. It is you, after all, who will have to explain things when the performance falls.<br />
Everyone hates to be the bad guy, that too, when you are new. But you have to find a balance between micromanaging and giving no direction at all. Keep your mind open for suggestions, listen to everyone, but ultimately you have to decide on the final direction your team/company takes. Also, do not excuse any slack behavior. Tardiness or frequent leaves should not be taken lightly.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 3 &#8211; Setting Uniform, Inflexible Rules</h3>
<p>If an employee is frequently late or absent, take him/her to task, but first, do understand the reasons behind this issue. Some of them might be suffering from a health condition, or they might have a sick relative at home. Same goes for other aspects of the job too.<br />
While focusing on performance and target, it is easy to forget that you are dealing with people &#8211; not processes or software which are programmed to run in a certain way. Understand that every employee is different, and will respond differently to authority or pressure. Rather than take offense, it is best to find a way around.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 4 &#8211; Not Being Clear With Instructions</h3>
<p>A few months? What exactly do you mean by few &#8211; is it two or six? As the planner, you might have a clear, precise idea of what you want. But you also need to convey that to your subordinates. Being too vague can leave them confused and lose trust in you.<br />
Make a clear, concise, and precise guideline. Give the employees fixed goals and targets. Numbers, not approximates. They need to have a proper idea of how their performance will be measured, to stay motivated and work efficiently and smartly.</p>
<h3>Mistake No. 5 &#8211; Overestimating Yourself and Your Team</h3>
<p>New managers are often eager and overenthusiastic. Free from the crutches of their B-school or the restrictions of their previous job, they want to prove a lot. Brimming with new ideas, they just can&#8217;t wait to implement them and the processes that they learned. They want to bring about a positive change, and fast.<br />
This enthusiasm is very infectious, affecting the entire team, resulting in a boost in productivity and morale. But, unfortunately, it also means that the goals they set are also unrealistically high. Other employees may take time adjusting to the sudden changes a new manager and his new processes demand. Add to that, they both will need to be perfected and tweaked till you get the expected results. So, set realistic goals, and accept that the new processes might also result in losses.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are so many elements today in our lives that make things more and more hectic by the day, and there hardly seems to be any respite from the constantly mounting pressures and tough competition to stay ahead of everybody, plan for the future, etc. However, this has also led to rising stress-related issues, blood pressure, etc. While one cannot simply sit at home to avoid all this, a bit of humor has always helped in bringing cheer to oneâ€™s day.<br />
Yes, it is true. Just one good joke in a day can actually relieve a high amount of stress, and make your hormones come to their normal levels despite all the anxiety and pressures of the professional life. Think of it this way, has not there been a day when you were told a joke by a friend or relative on the phone or via SMS, and you kept on thinking about the same throughout the day, and had a great, stress-free working experience. You might also have spread the cheer by telling the joke to your colleagues, thereby also brightening their day and bringing some laughter in their lives. Is not this proof enough of what a great joke can do to your entire day?<br />
Presently, there are many sources from where one can get funny jokes, with the best one being the internet. Clearly, there are quite a few of those who like to share their humorous side online, which is visible from the great compilation of jokes that are available online. There are many kinds of redhead jokes, lawyer jokes, doctor jokes, and so on, giving you ample variety in terms of choosing the kind of laugh you want to have according to your taste.<br />
But one thing that must be kept in mind is that these jokes are completely in the spirit of humor, and should be taken sportingly, and not personally. Remember, it takes only 7 muscles to smile, and 32 to frown, and the former always gets a better reaction from the other person.</p>
