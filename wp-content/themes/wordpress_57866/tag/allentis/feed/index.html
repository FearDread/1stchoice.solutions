<p>Thousands of people dream of having their own business and even more so be a successful entrepreneur. But what does it take to achieve success in the business industry?</p>
<p>One of the most successful entrepreneurs featured at the Forbes website, Wendy Lipton &#8211; Dibner said that &#8220;the success of your business would solely depend on you. The only thing you can rely on is your power to achieve your goal&#8221;.<br />
She shared her success story at the Forbes website and said that when she was young she learned a very important business objective from her high school activity and that is to go out, explore, come back and explain how money is made in business. This is an objective she never forgot until she made millions for herself.</p>
<p>When she was already very successful, she never stopped understanding business and how it really works. Profit is the number one goal in business and how you make it is a natural talent. Yes, there may be a lot of guidelines given and showed on television and the internet but only you know how you will make your sales to the top.</p>
<p>Try to ponder on these notes when thinking of a business:</p>
<p>1.) Passion. Business may be set on profit but the core of your business should be something you love. Passion counts a lot in businesses because it also builds your determination in achieving your goal.</p>
<p>2.) Impact. Business is a big and competitive world, what will matter is how you make a difference to your market. How your business will impact your market. The profit of your business will rely on the impact of your business. The mark it will leave to your customers will make it grow.</p>
<p>3.) Three Guidelines.</p>
<p>If you have noticed, the three guidelines below are very simple and natural.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rumi, is the most popular Sufi poet in the world. His work is not only deep and intense, but also very ethereal. His poetry often stirs an emotion never touched and shows a facet never seen. This Buzzle article has a collection of some beautiful Rumi quotes that are worth reading, without which, life would literally feel quite disregarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you start to walk on the way, the way appears.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Two there are who are never satisfied &#8212; the lover of the world and the lover of knowledge.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What you seek is seeking you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be satisfied with stories, how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do you know what you are? You are a manuscript o∆í a divine letter. You are a mirror reflecting a noble face. This universe is not outside of you. Look inside yourself; everything that you want, you are already that.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t grieve. Anything you lose comes round in another form.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Start a huge, foolish project, like Noah&#8230;it makes absolutely no difference what people think of you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;When you go through a hard period, when everything seems to oppose you, &#8230; When you feel you cannot even bear one more minute, NEVER GIVE UP! Because it is the time and place that the course will divert!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So how to keep your heart healthy? With so many heart diseases on the rise, most health-conscious people strive to seek the answer to this question. This article attempts to help you find the answer.</p>
<h3>Go Green</h3>
<p>When we speak of heart, we cannot miss out on the importance and benefits of plant foods. Vegetables are an excellent source of glutamic acid. It is a class of amino acid which helps keeping blood pressure at lower levels; safe levels, so to say. What&#8217;s more? Veggies lack cholesterol, fat and even calories, which otherwise tend to be the common culprits for causing heart diseases. Not to mention, the amount of vitamins and minerals that vegetables provide to the body do the most for health.</p>
<h3>Be Active</h3>
<p>Without the aid of daily exercise, maintaining a good overall health is just more than a daunting task. Exercises not only improve heart function, but also help in bringing down blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in the body. A mere 30 minutes stroll daily does good for the heart, if not much. It is recommended that sprinting is more beneficial for the heart, than jogging.</p>
<h3>Reduce Oil</h3>
<p>The next tip is about keeping oil from your diet. Although, you cannot avoid oil completely, you can keep its consumption to a small amount. Oils are a storehouse of calories and contain little nutrition. As they mostly comprise fat, they have all chances to lead to the development of plaque in the arteries thus, giving rise to some nasty heart problems. However, not all types of oil are unhealthy. Fish oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which not only help in preventing cardiovascular diseases, but also reduce instances of heart attack. According to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, a group of patients with cardiovascular disease had 30% less likelihood of heart attack because of omega-3 fatty acids. Best sources include salmon, mackerel and herring. Flaxseed, walnuts, and soybeans are also good sources.</p>
<h3>Cut the Smoke</h3>
<p>If you think you cannot shun the habit of smoking, then you might as well know that you cannot do anything good for your heart. One of the most severe risks of smoking relates to heart diseases in almost every smoker. Quit smoking, and you have done half the job in keeping your heart healthy!</p>
<h3>Lose Weight</h3>
<p>If your figure is slim, and belly flat, then you may have less things to worry about heart diseases. I am talking about weight loss. Being overweight puts extra load on the heart thus, increases the risk of heart conditions. So, consume less sugary foods and more of fiber and complex carbohydrates, and fruits and vegetables. Maintaining a healthy weight is one of the basic necessities for a healthy heart today.</p>
<h3>Add More Fiber</h3>
<p>Fiber exists in two major groups; soluble (dissolves in water) and insoluble (does not dissolve in water). Although both the types are beneficial to health, it is the former type that does way better to reduce cholesterol levels in the body. Due to its soluble nature, it binds with the cholesterol in the intestines thus, keep it from being absorbed. This keeps the level of LDL and total cholesterol down, while not affecting the HDL cholesterol level in any way. All a healthy person requires is a serving of 5 to 10 grams or more of soluble fiber in a day to avail this benefit of low cholesterol. Foods rich in this fiber include apples, peas, kidney beans, prunes, etc.</p>
<h3>Beware of Saturated Fats</h3>
<p>It is important that you limit the amount of saturated and trans fats you consume from your food. These spike cholesterol levels in the body thus, increasing the risk of coronary artery disease. So avoid or limit consumption of food such as red meat, dairy products, coconut oil, palm oil. These are rich in saturated fatty acids. To avoid trans fats, eat less of fast foods, bakery products, snacks, crackers, and margarines. Go for foods rich in healthy fats such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.</p>
<h3>Eat Less Salt</h3>
<p>Sodium is good for the body, but in petty amounts. High salt intake means high blood pressure, which eventually points out to heart conditions. When sodium starts accumulating in the blood, it attracts water which in turn, increases the blood volume. Now to keep this blood circulating through the blood vessels, the heart has to work harder thus, causing high blood pressure. The recommended amount of sodium in the food per day must be less than 2300 milligrams.</p>
<h3>Take the Right Medication</h3>
<p>In most cases, heart diseases are also related to the use of drugs. So, it is important that you take medicines as prescribed by the doctors, or get them altered if necessary.</p>
<h3>Moderate Alcohol</h3>
<p>Drinking alcohol in moderate amounts does not harm the body. In fact, some studies show that moderate consumption provides some benefits for the heart. However, the habit of drinking is analogous to walking on thin ice. It is not difficult for any one to step out of his limit, and become a heavy drinker. So, ensure that either you stick to moderate drinking or you don&#8217;t drink at all.</p>
<h3>Manage Stress</h3>
<p>Stress has also been known to be one of the common culprits of heart problems. Any stressful situation elevates blood pressure and this response takes its toll on the heart. So, keep yourself relaxed by practicing meditation, yoga, and other relaxation techniques.</p>
<p>To conclude, make a note of the above methods, and keep them handy in case you find it difficult to recall them. And now I would like to take your leave, as I have some sprinting to do! Take care!</p>
